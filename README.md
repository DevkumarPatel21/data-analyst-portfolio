# Data-Analyst-portfolio
This repository is mainly for projects I have done under during my post graduation in Data Analytic for Business.

My preparation for a future as a data analyst comes from the data analytic curriculum at St. Clair College,Canada in  which I learn how to clean and organise data, spot patterns and insights, make meaningful inferences, and effectively convey important findings. As I construct a portfolio of projects, I am becoming more proficient in Excel,Power Query, SQL, Python, R-Programming and its data analysis tools (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Tensorflow, Keras). For the visualization I have strong hands on tableau, PowerBI and also did some other exciting things on Google Analytics. I have also done some case studies and project in project management.

Tips: For data science projects with python, I would recomend you to install numpy , pandas , scipy , scikit learn , matplotlib , seaborn thest basic libraries.

# Portfolio Projects:
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.
### Projects based on Marketing Analysis 
In the marketing analysis I have done several projects where I have perform the churn prection analysis, customer segementation analysis, sentimnetal analysis using Natural language processing and done some analysis on the customer behviour and product behviour. 
Below is the numbers of project which I have done and there link of the project where it direct you to the project in which detail explanation of the project is given.

#### Churn Prediction Analysis on Telecommunication
##### Code:https://github.com/DevkumarPatel21/data-analyst-portfolio/tree/main/Marketing_Analysis/Churn_Prediction_Analysis/Project_Churn_Prediction_Analysis.ipynb
##### Description: [The dataset contains 7043 instances with 21 features. There is list of features have been shown in the python file. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing customer churn rate based on the several factors related with the features.]
##### Skills:
Data cleaning, Data preprocessing, Data analysis, Data visualization.
##### Technology
Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
##### Result
The feature in which company has to target to reduce the churn and based on that the necessaru recommendation is given to company.

#### Customer Segmentation on App Usage
##### Code:https://github.com/DevkumarPatel21/data-analyst-portfolio/blob/main/Marketing_Analysis/Customer_segmentation/Project_Customer_Segmentation.ipynb
##### Description:
The dataset contains 541909 instances with 8 feature of the sales dataset. The dataset is above the different groups of customer who used to purchased the product or services. So here in this project I have perform segmentation on different group of people using RFM and I can able to segement those customer who are loyal, who are more likely to stop the services. The detailed explanation is given in the python file.
##### Skills 
Data cleaning, Data preprocessing, Data insights, Data visualization.
##### Technology
Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, machine learning models like k-means clustering 
##### Result
Recency, Frequnecy and Monetary(RFM) is being perform and several graphs plotted to get insights of the data which recommendation is given.

#### Mobile Apps Behvioural Analysis
##### Code:
##### Description:
The dataset contians the 50000 records with 12 features of Mobile App data. Here in this dataset our dependent variable is 'Enrolled' which plays important factor in this project. Based on the this features i can analyze the number of user who enrolled in the mobile app with respect to factors like age, numscreen, minigame, premium feature.e project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), feature engineering.
##### Skills: 
Data cleaning, Data preprocessing, Data insights, Data visualization, Feature Engineering, Model Building, Feature Scaling.
##### Models:
Logistic Regression 
##### Performance Measure:
Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 score.
##### Technology:
Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
##### Result: 
Based on the insights the
