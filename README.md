# Data-Analyst-portfolio
This repository is mainly for projects I have done under during my post graduation in Data Analytic for Business.

My preparation for a future as a data analyst comes from the data analytic curriculum at St. Clair College,Canada in  which I learn how to clean and organise data, spot patterns and insights, make meaningful inferences, and effectively convey important findings. As I construct a portfolio of projects, I am becoming more proficient in Excel,Power Query, SQL, Python, R-Programming and its data analysis tools (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Tensorflow, Keras). For the visualization I have strong hands on tableau, PowerBI and also did some other exciting things on Google Analytics. I have also done some case studies and project in project management.

Tips: For data science projects with python, I would recomend you to install numpy , pandas , scipy , scikit learn , matplotlib , seaborn thest basic libraries.
