# Project Scope
The project's goal is to alter the way customers purchase food from restaurants online. Compared to traveling to the food court, where you would have to wait and eat, this procedure saves time and is simpler and faster. The primary goal of the project is to reduce the amount of human data entry and streamline the ordering process for both customers and restaurants.

#Project Objective
-> To create an online food ordering application, which includes multiple features such as the ability to filter food choices by different cuisine types, distance,price, and other food categories. 
-> Placing orders in the application, by adding food items to the cart, making online payments, confirming customer details, and asking for customer reviews post-delivery. 
-> Further, a working tracking feature will be delivered, where the customer will receive updates for when their order is being prepared, dispatched, etc.
-> An invoicing feature will be added as well, where a digital receipt will be generated for the customer and will be mailed to their provided email address or phone number. 
-> A working backend feature will be created where restaurant owners can update their restaurant menus on their own from the app directly. 

# Ordering System Module:
 
 Function of this module will be,
 
 -> Provide info to for customers to place their order and necessary details.
 
 -> Users of the system(customers) must have to create an account to create an order, so this project app must provide the following functionality:
 
 -> Create an account, Manage account, Login Page, Navigate to restaurant's menu, Select items from the menu, Add an item to the current order.
 
 -> Review the current order, If wants, Remove an item from the current order, Provide Checkout bill and Payment page, Receive confirmation by phone or email once payment is successfully completed, View and track the placed order.
 
 -> Rating the restaurant.
  
# Admin-Menu Mgt System Module:

Function of this module is only for user-Administrator, it will allow an Admin to manage the menu that is displayed to users of the web ordering system: 

-> Add/update/delete food category to/from the menu.

-> Add /update/delete food item to/from the menu.

-> Update price for a given food item.

-> Update additional information (description, photo, etc.) for a given food item.

# Evaluation Baseline
These were the project objectives that were defined beforehand – 
  1. Total Project Budget – 142,000
  2. Project Estimated Completion Time – 36 days
  3.Total Project Tasks – 6, Subtasks – 19 tasks

Based on requirements, Developer’s, Programmers and Project Managers were assigned to the project.
For this project we have used the bottom-up approach for cost estimation and assigned budgets to each task and compared it with actual costs. 
We have carried out earned value analysis for this project, to see based on the current status of the project what our cost variance, schedule variance and project overview is.

# Project Overview
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111020984/213755746-e54d448d-a375-4fa4-94c0-b6802263edc3.png)

Currently based on the project’s present status, it is 88% complete. 
Our project was supposed to finish by 6th December 2022, but based on the analysis done on 6th December, currently the project has not finished.

In the above slide, we can see that tasks 5 is partially incomplete and 6 is fully incomplete, which shouldn’t be the case. Based on the target set, the project should’ve been completed by now.

The Developer resource has been assigned to these tasks, and majority of that resource is left to be used, we can also note that here.

# Burndown Chart

## Burndown chart analysis
-> The burndown chart here is generated here is from 1st November 2022 to 6th December 2022.
We can see based on the line chart that based on the baseline given, work should have been finished by now, but we are behind schedule.

-> The work burndown shows us here that around 20-30 hours of work is remaining still, and the task burndown shows us that more than 4 subtasks are left to complete still.

-> Based on these details we can solidify further by detail how behind schedule we are. 

# Cost Overview
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111020984/213756488-242d0066-2705-4ef3-ae07-2a0619ec44a1.png)

-> Based on the cost overview dashboard, we can see that up to this point, $139,415 has been spent on this project.

-> Also based on the progress vs cost chart, we can see that the we’ve not completely the project based on the baseline cost defined.

-> Only 88% of the project has been finished and still to finish the rest, an expense of 20,500 is still left.

-> So even though currently we are under budget, our project hasn’t finished. So, we will have to allocate new resources to speed up our project completion which will obviously push our project over-budget. 

-> Based on the cost status report, we can see that currently $139,415 has been used up in the project and we are $2585 under budget but are project hasn’t finished completely and an estimated $20,500 are still left.

# Upcoming tasks for the project

Here based on the work burndown chart we can see the effort of hours that remains in the project.

Up to now 184 hours of work has been completed and 24 hours of work effort remains.

Again, based on the charts created we can see we are behind schedule based on work remaining to be done.

# EARNED VALUE REPORT
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111020984/213758830-a1abb1da-122d-462f-9ba3-4749e5117d04.png)
Based on the earned value report we can draw the following conclusions:
 Here our estimated actual cost at completion is $138,978.85 and our total allocated budget is $142,000. Even though the system here is predicting us to stay under budget till late completion, it cannot be guaranteed that our actual cost will be under budget at completion.

Our actual cost currently is lower than the earned value, meaning that we are currently under budget, but because we’ve passed the project completion date, we are bound to add more resources and go over budget and finish the project late.

Looking at the variance over time chart, we can see that during the middle of our project there were certain tasks which went over budge due to which we have a negative cost variance, and our schedule variance is also negative completely because we couldn’t finish certain tasks on time to meet the end date.

# Schedule and cost variance over time

Based on the SPI and CPI spread we can see that we went over budget during the middle of our project but then came back on track during the end, but still we haven’t finished our project.

Our SPI trend shows that we couldn’t finish all the tasks until the required end date and are behind schedule currently in our project.
